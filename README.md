# VXCore Lua SDK

The *VXCore Lua SDK* is the official Lua scripting interface specifically designed for Vortex Interactive's games. With this scripting SDK, developers can access all of VXCore's scripting functionality.

# Purpose

The primary purpose of the VXCore Lua SDK is to bridge engine functionality and game development, providing the tools to create game behavior without the need to tinker with the engine's core code.

# Modding and Community Use

While the VXCore Lua SDK is primarily intended for our in-house development, we have made it publicly available for the community. We understand that the same tools we use internally can be used by the community to create amazing modifications and custom content for our games.

# Contributing

Contributions to the VXCore Lua SDK are limited to Vortex Interactive's internal development team. Ho6wever, we welcome feedback and suggestions from the community and modders who are using the SDK for their projects. Your insights can help us improve the SDK for both internal and external use.

> Note: The VXCore Lua SDK is not just for modding purposes but also an integral part of our internal development pipeline, providing the core features that our editor relies on for syntax and visualization.
